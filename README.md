# revibe

_revibe_ is a project I developed together with three friends for half 2021.

This app creates personalized music playlists using artificial intelligence to help people relax.

I was in charge of the machine learning area, where I developed two main algorithms:

1. An improved, UX-friendlier Anxiety Inventory to efficiently measure anxiety of our users and test our recommendation algorithm. Here I used dataset.csv.
2. The recommendation algorithm, which automatically learns how different songs impact the mood of each particular person.

In **revibe_tester.ipynb** you can find the different experiments I did.

A clearer, more detailed and more beautiful explanation of this project can be found in **revibe_presentacion.pdf**.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to DM me.
